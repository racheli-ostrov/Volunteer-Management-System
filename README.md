## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The project is structured into three distinct layers to ensure a clean separation of responsibilities:

1.  **Presentation Layer (WPF):** Handles the UI logic, XAML styles, and user interactions.
2.  **Business Logic Layer (BLL):** Contains the core application logic, validation rules, and processing.
3.  **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Manages data persistence and communication with data sources.

## 📈 Engineering Best Practices

* **Clean Code:** Highly readable code with meaningful naming conventions.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Using `async/await` to keep the UI thread responsive during heavy operations.
* **Modularity:** Loosely coupled components to facilitate easier unit testing.
